MATH

line
    passes through both head and tail coordinates, extends infinitely in both directions, does not terminate, does not point in either direction
line segment
    terminates at both head and tail coordinates, does not point in either direction
vector AKA free vector
    terminates at head coordinates only, points from direction of origin to head, has no tail
bound vector AKA fixed vector AKA localized vector AKA ray
    terminates at both head and tail coordinates, points from tail to head
origin
    point with 0 for all coordinates; (0, 0, 0) in 3D
tail AKA initial point
    starting point of bound vector
head
    ending point of vector


PHYSICS

force vector
    bound vector representing physical force
point of application
    head (or sometimes tail) of force vector, point upon which force works
line of action
    line along which a force vector lies
sliding vector
    bound vector which can move along its line of action without changing
